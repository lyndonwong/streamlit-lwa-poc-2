# STREAMLIT LWA POC

### GOAL 

Confirm whether a streamlit app can provide a map view with the following features:

1. Filter plotted project locations by traits such as "commercial project", "residential project", "mixed-use project", "estimated value < $10M", "estimated value > $10M"

2. Show details of a plotted project on rollover (tool tip ux)

3. Enable click through from plotted project to more details or related commission meeting minutes / transcripts.
